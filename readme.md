# Project 1
## Description
We have built this travel app to help users find userful relevant information regarding a destination they are visiting on the fly. This information includes, basic information about the location, the current weather conditions, upcoming events in the area as well as information for hotel accomodations.

## Installation
In order to install the application one simply needs to open the following [link](https://andrethetallguy.github.io/Project-1/) in their browser of choice.

## Usage
Usage of the app is very straightforward, users will find themselves on the landing page upon loading and will be given the option to eitber search for a destination or choose one from the list of popular destinations. Upon searching all relevant information will be populated on the page. If the user wants to search for another destination they simply just type that into the search bar.
